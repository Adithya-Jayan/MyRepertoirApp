REPORTED BUGS AND ISSUES - REPERTOIRE APP REFACTORING and fixes
=====================================================

DATE: December 2024
STATUS: REFACTORING TO BE DONE

NEW High priority issues found to be fixed: [To be tested and marked as complete after each fix]
=========================================

1. ❌ Updating the number of columns in the personalization settings, and navigating back to the gallery does not show the updated columns.
   - A manual refresh is required to update gallery columns right now.
   - FIXED: Updated personalization screen to return true on navigation back, triggering library reload
   - Fix failed. The library still does not update unless manually refreshed. Logging can be added to verify after the fix if the library is being rebuilt with the right number of columns.

2. Swiping to move between gallery groups is choppy and not smooth. There is a visible glitch during the slide where the screen abdruptly changes.

3. The search bar functionality in the gallery is not as expected. The typing gets interruptd, and the cursor gets moved to the start after each character is entered.

4. ❌ The tag group colour selection seems to have dissappeared completely. The earlier present option in the edit tag group to select the tag colour is now missing.
   - The feature is still present since older pieces which already had colours selected still retains it.
   - FIXED: Uncommented and fixed color selection dropdown in TagGroupSection
   - Fix is not perfect. The previous colours used (Visible in the template items) are different from the ones in the drop down. The original colours were a little less saturated.

5. The thumbnails loading for pieces occurs on every save. 
   - Insteaed, we should add a 'Get thumbnail' button on the edit screen which is manually triggered. Automatic download of thumbnails is to be removed.
   - A remove thumbnail option should appear once thumbnail is present.In case the user does not want to have one. 
   - This will prevent Unnecessary re-downloads as well.

6. The handle bars in the edit group page are only visible in windows builds but not the android builds. 
   - This needs to be made consistent.

7. Making changes to a piece and saving it does not update the piece immediately and automatically.
   - The piece only updates on returning to the gallery and re-visiting the piece. This refresh should happen on the save in the settings page.

8. Refactor code to keep individual file sizes below 200 lines. Improve comments and documentation.
