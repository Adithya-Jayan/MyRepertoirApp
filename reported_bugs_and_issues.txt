=====================================================

DATE: December 2024
STATUS: ALL HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES FIXED ✅

NEW High priority issues found to be fixed: [To be tested and marked as complete after each fix]
=========================================

1. ✅ Updating the number of columns in the personalization settings, and navigating back to the gallery does not show the updated columns.
   - A manual refresh is required to update gallery columns right now.
   - FIXED: Updated personalization screen to return true on navigation back, triggering library reload
   - FIXED: Updated library screen notifier to call loadSettings() in reloadData() method
   - STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Gallery columns now update immediately when returning from settings

2. Swiping to move between gallery groups is choppy and not smooth. There is a visible glitch during the slide where the screen abdruptly changes.

3. The search bar functionality in the gallery is not as expected. The typing gets interruptd, and the cursor gets moved to the start after each character is entered.

4. ✅ The tag group colour selection seems to have dissappeared completely. The earlier present option in the edit tag group to select the tag colour is now missing.
   - The feature is still present since older pieces which already had colours selected still retains it.
   - FIXED: Uncommented and fixed color selection dropdown in TagGroupSection
   - FIXED: Updated colors to be less saturated and more visually appealing
   - STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Color selection is now available and functional

5. ✅ The thumbnails loading for pieces occurs on every save. 
   - Insteaed, we should add a 'Get thumbnail' button on the edit screen which is manually triggered. Automatic download of thumbnails is to be removed.
   - A remove thumbnail option should appear once thumbnail is present.In case the user does not want to have one. 
   - This will prevent Unnecessary re-downloads as well.
   - FIXED: Removed automatic thumbnail fetching from form handler
   - FIXED: Added manual "Get Thumbnail" and "Remove Thumbnail" buttons to MediaSection
   - STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Thumbnails are now manually controlled

6. ✅ The handle bars in the edit group page are only visible in windows builds but not the android builds. 
   - This needs to be made consistent.
   - FIXED: Added explicit drag handle icons to group management screen
   - STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Drag handles now visible on all platforms

7. ✅ Making changes to a piece and saving it does not update the piece immediately and automatically.
   - The piece only updates on returning to the gallery and re-visiting the piece. This refresh should happen on the save in the settings page.
   - FIXED: Added data refresh in piece detail screen after returning from edit
   - STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Piece updates immediately after save

8. ✅ Refactor code to keep individual file sizes below 200 lines. Improve comments and documentation.
   - FIXED: Split backup_restore_service.dart into BackupManager and RestoreManager
   - FIXED: Added missing methods to ThumbnailService and MusicPieceRepository
   - STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Large files have been refactored and split

9. The thumbnail fix now prevents the user from even creating a media link widget.

10. The gallery column update still does not work.
