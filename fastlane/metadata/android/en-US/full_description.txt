Repertoire is a cross-platform application designed for musicians, dancers, magicians, or performers to help manage their repertoire (musical pieces, dance routines, or even magic tricks).
The app helps you keep your sheet music, notes, audio recordings, videos, links, and practice logs neatly organized for every piece in your collection.

    - Log your practice sessions. Keep in touch with stuff you learnt over time.
